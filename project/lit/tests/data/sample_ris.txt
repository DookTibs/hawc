AB  - When chlorine is introduced into public drinking water for disinfection, it can react with organic compounds in surface waters to form toxic by-products such as 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2[5H]-furanone (MX). We investigated the effect of exposure to MX on cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1)-like activity and total glutathione (GSH) in the liver of the small fish model, medaka (Oryzias latipes). The multi-site carcinogen methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAMAc) was the positive control compound. Both medaka liver microsome preparations and S-9 fractions catalyzed the hydroxylation of p-nitrophenol (PNP), suggesting CYP2E1-like activity in the medaka. Male medaka exposed for 96 h to the CYP2E1 inducers ethanol and acetone under fasted conditions showed significant increases in PNP-hydroxylation activity. Furthermore, total reduced hepatic GSH was reduced in fish fasted for 96 h, indicating that normal feeding is a factor in maintaining xenobiotic defenses. Exposure to MX and MAMAc induced significant increases in hepatic CYP2E1-like activity, however MX exposure did not alter hepatic GSH levels. These data strengthen the role of the medaka as a suitable species for examining cytochrome P450 and GSH detoxification processes and the role these systems play in chemical carcinogenesis. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Disinfection byproducts of chlorination such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids (HAAs) are some of the most prevalent contaminants that appear in municipal water supplies. Thus, large populations of humans are continually exposed to low concentrations of these potential toxicants. Previous studies have shown that some of these contaminants are weakly genotoxic in the Comet Assay and induce different types of tumors in animal carcinogenicity studies. In the studies reported here, we tested how the addition of HAAs, specifically dichloroacetic acid (DCA) [500 mg/l], bromochloroacetic acid (BCA)[500 mg/l], or dibromoacetic acid (DBA) [500 mg/l], to the drinking water of male F344 rats affected precursor lesions in the colon. In the first study colons were analyzed for aberrant crypt foci (ACF) after 52 weeks of exposure. Only BCA caused a statistically significant increase in ACF. In a follow-up study male and female F344 rats were exposed to 0, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/l BCA in drinking water for 26 and 52 weeks. ACF were significantly increased in the high dose group in males at 52 weeks and at all dose levels at both 26 and 52 weeks in the females. These findings support prior carcinogenicity studies showing that, of the three HAAs tested, only BCA induced tumors (adenomas) in the colon. The results also indicate that ACF as early as 26 weeks may serve as predictive biomarkers of later tumorigenesis. This abstract does not necessarily reflect US EPA policy.

AB  - Bromate, a common disinfectant byproduct of drinking water ozonation, has been linked to human and animal renal toxicity, including renal cell carcinomas in multiple animal species. Here, we evaluate changes in protein and gene expression through two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and Affymetrix arrays to identify potential modes of action involved in potassium bromate carcinogenicity. Male rats were exposed to potassium bromate in drinking water at concentrations of 0, 1, 20 and 400 ppm for two weeks. Differential expression of glycolytic proteins including enolase 1 (Eno1), triosephosphate isomerase 1 (Tpi1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) suggests that bromate toxicity is associated with changes in energy consumption and utilization in renal cells involving up-regulation of glycolytic processes that may be the result of altered mitochondrial function. Several alterations in glycolysis and mitochondrial gene transcripts were also observed to be consistent with this mode of action. These studies provide insight into early events in renal cell physiology altered by bromate exposure.

AB  - Aberrant crypt foci (ACF), identified as putative precursor lesions in the development of colon cancer, were induced by brominated trihalomethanes (THMs) administered in the drinking water of rats. To investigate whether ACF induced by THMs could be promoted by a diet high in saturated animal fat, male F344/N rats were exposed to 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 or 1.1 g/l of trichloromethane (TCM), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), dibromochloromethane (DBCM) and tribromomethane (TBM), respectively, in drinking water. All animals were fed a Purina 5001 diet with half receiving the normal 4.5% fat feed and half receiving feed supplemented with 19% animal fat. After 26 weeks of treatment, colons were excised and examined for ACF. No difference in ACF was noted between animals fed a normal or high fat diet and exposed to TCM, BDCM or DBCM. However, animals exposed to TBM and fed a high fat diet showed a significant and near two-fold increase in ACF when compared to TBM exposed animals fed a normal diet.

AB  - An exploratory study of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and SCCmec elements in bacteria along the Mexican border of south Texas was performed. Between September and December of 2008, 375 swabs of anterior nares were self-collected by students attending the University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA) and cultured for MRSA. Fifty seven bacterial isolates were kept for further analysis that included suspected MRSA and other SCCmec-containing bacteria. Isolates were examined for the presence of nuc, mecA, lukS-PV, and spa genes using PCR. SCCmec and spa typing were also performed. Seven S. aureus isolates were found of which six were classified as MRSA. SCCmec typing showed five of the six MRSA strains to be type IV, while one MRSA strain, and most of the non-S. aureus strains, were untypeable, producing results that were indicative of mixed SCCmec types. Five of the six MRSA strains contained known spa types (two of which corresponded to USA300 and one to USA600), while one strain had a novel spa type. Only one isolate, a USA300 MRSA, was positive for lukS-PV. Easy access by the Texas border community to antibiotics in Mexico without a prescription, and the strong partition in SCCmec types between MRSA and non-S. aureus bacteria suggest that this border region of Texas may be uniquely suited for the study of emerging SCCmec types, their horizontal transfer, and perhaps other aspects of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - Mutagenicity assays with Salmonella have shown that 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy2[5H]-furanone (MX), a drinking-water disinfection by-product, is a potent mutagen, accounting for about one-third of the mutagenic potency/potential of chlorinated drinking water. The ability of MX to induce mutations was investigated in the liver of medaka (Oryzias latipes), a small fish model, utilizing the cll transgenic medaka strain that allows detection of in vivo mutations. Methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAMAc), a carcinogen in medaka, served as a positive control. Fish were exposed to MX at 0, 1, 10, or 30 mg/L for 96h, whereas the MAMAc exposures were for 2 h at 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/L. Both exposures were conducted under static water conditions and with fasted medaka. Following exposure, fish were returned to regular culture conditions to allow mutation expression for 15 or 40 d for MX or for 15 or 32 d for MAMAc. Mutations were not induced in medaka exposed to MX for 96 h. However, a concentration- and time-dependent increase in mutations was observed from the livers of fish exposed to I and 10 mg/L MAMAc. In conclusion, mutation induction was not observed in the livers of cll medaka exposed to MX for 96 h; however, studies are planned to examine mutation induction in the gills and skin to explore the possibility that MX-induced DNA damage occurs primarily in the tissues of initial contact.
