        Regulatory agencies around the world conduct assessments to determine the potential for chemicals to pose a threat to human health. These assessments typically consist of critical review of available studies, identify adverse health effects of chemicals, and characterize exposure-response relationships and the uncertainties in the database. This project aims to facilitate  collaborative work by the team of scientists who develop assessments and to enhance the transparency of the process by providing online access to the data and expert decisions used to evaluate the potential human health hazard and risk of chemical exposures.

        HAWC is a modular content-management system designed to store, display and synthesize multiple data sources for the purpose of producing human health assessments of chemicals. This online application documents the overall workflow that is followed in the process of developing an assessment, from literature search and systematic review, to data extraction, dose-response analysis, evidence synthesis, uncertainty characterization, and creation of customized reports for public release.
