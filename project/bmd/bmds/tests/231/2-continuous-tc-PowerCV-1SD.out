   The form of the response function is: 

   Y[dose] = control + slope * dose^power


   Dependent variable = Response
   Independent variable = Dose
   rho is set to 0
   The power is restricted to be greater than or equal to 1
   A constant variance model is fit

   Total number of dose groups = 5
   Total number of records with missing values = 0
   Maximum number of iterations = 250
   Relative Function Convergence has been set to: 1e-008

 Model Descriptions for likelihoods calculated


 Model A1:        Yij = Mu(i) + e(ij)
           Var{e(ij)} = Sigma^2

 Model A2:        Yij = Mu(i) + e(ij)
           Var{e(ij)} = Sigma(i)^2

 Model A3:        Yij = Mu(i) + e(ij)
           Var{e(ij)} = Sigma^2
     Model A3 uses any fixed variance parameters that
     were specified by the user

 Model  R:         Yi = Mu + e(i)
            Var{e(i)} = Sigma^2

                   Explanation of Tests  

 Test 1:  Do responses and/or variances differ among Dose levels? 
          (A2 vs. R)
 Test 2:  Are Variances Homogeneous? (A1 vs A2)
 Test 3:  Are variances adequately modeled? (A2 vs. A3)
 Test 4:  Does the Model for the Mean Fit? (A3 vs. fitted)
 (Note:  When rho=0 the results of Test 3 and Test 2 will be the same.)

                     Tests of Interest    

   Test    -2*log(Likelihood Ratio)  Test df        p-value    

   Test 1              128.147          8          <.0001
   Test 2              38.9552          4          <.0001
   Test 3              38.9552          4          <.0001
   Test 4              16.9659          2        0.000207

The p-value for Test 1 is less than .05.  There appears to be a
difference between response and/or variances among the dose levels
It seems appropriate to model the data

The p-value for Test 2 is less than .1.  Consider running a 
non-homogeneous variance model

The p-value for Test 3 is less than .1.  You may want to consider a 
different variance model

The p-value for Test 4 is less than .1.  You may want to try a different 
model
