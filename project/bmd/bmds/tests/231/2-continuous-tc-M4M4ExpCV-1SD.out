   The form of the response function by Model: 
      Model 2:     Y[dose] = a * exp{sign * b * dose}
      Model 3:     Y[dose] = a * exp{sign * (b * dose)^d}
      Model 4:     Y[dose] = a * [c-(c-1) * exp{-b * dose}]
      Model 5:     Y[dose] = a * [c-(c-1) * exp{-(b * dose)^d}]

    Note: Y[dose] is the median response for exposure = dose;
          sign = +1 for increasing trend in data;
          sign = -1 for decreasing trend.

      Model 2 is nested within Models 3 and 4.
      Model 3 is nested within Model 5.
      Model 4 is nested within Model 5.


   Dependent variable = Response
   Independent variable = Dose
   Data are assumed to be distributed: normally
   Variance Model: exp(lnalpha +rho *ln(Y[dose]))
   rho is set to 0.
   A constant variance model is fit.

   Total number of dose groups = 5
   Total number of records with missing values = 0
   Maximum number of iterations = 250
   Relative Function Convergence has been set to: 1e-008
   Parameter Convergence has been set to: 1e-008

   Additive constant for all log-likelihoods =     -91.89.  This constant added to the
   above values gives the log-likelihood including the term that does not
   depend on the model parameters.


                                 Explanation of Tests

   Test 1:  Does response and/or variances differ among Dose levels? (A2 vs. R)
   Test 2:  Are Variances Homogeneous? (A2 vs. A1)
   Test 3:  Are variances adequately modeled? (A2 vs. A3)

   Test 6a: Does Model 4 fit the data? (A3 vs 4)

     Test 2                         38.96           4            < 0.0001
     Test 3                         38.96           4            < 0.0001

     The p-value for Test 1 is less than .05.  There appears to be a
     difference between response and/or variances among the dose
     levels, it seems appropriate to model the data.

     The p-value for Test 2 is less than .1.  Consider running
     a non-homogeneous variance model.

     The p-value for Test 3 is less than .1.  You may want to
     consider a different variance model.

     The p-value for Test 6a is less than .1.  Model 4 may not adequately
     describe the data; you may want to consider another model.
